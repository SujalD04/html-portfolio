<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey There! I'm Sujal, a 19-year-old CS student here at VIT University in Vellore, India. <br/>
  Diving into a little detail about myself, 
  Computers are my thing, and I'm really into web<br/> and game development – 
  that's the career path I'm aiming for. Outside of classes, you'll<br/> find me browsing the web, playing sports, 
  or just diving into whatever catches my eye.<br/> Big music fan here – it helps me focus when I need to knuckle down. 
  When something<br/> sparks my interest, I put my head down and work hard at it. 
  I'm usually pretty chill and<br/> keep to myself, but yeah, 
  I'll admit I can have a bit of a temper sometimes. Yep, that's<br/> about it for me. </p>
