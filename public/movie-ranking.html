<h1>The best animes According to myself (I dont watch movies)</h1>
<h2>Let me list my top 3 animes because I don't watch much movies.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p>Good story, animations and character<br/>
   Mappa could never miss out honestly.
</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>Another masterpiece and my fav elements about it include:<br/>
    1. Fights<br/>
    2. Animations<br/>
    3. Characters<br/>
</p>
<h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
<p>Good power system, waiting for the anime to finish yet though.<br/>
   Highly anticipated after its manhwa.</p>
